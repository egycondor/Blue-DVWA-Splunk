# Blue-DVWA-Splunk

Blue-DVWA-Splunk provides a Docker-based environment for running Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) alongside Splunk. Apache access and error logs generated by DVWA are forwarded to Splunk so you can experiment with log collection and analysis.

## Features
- Docker Compose setup for DVWA and Splunk Enterprise
- Splunk Universal Forwarder preconfigured to monitor Apache logs
- Sample Splunk props and transforms for basic field extraction

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/egycondor/Blue-DVWA-Splunk.git
   cd Blue-DVWA-Splunk
   ```
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` if you want to change the Splunk password. The `SPLUNK_PASSWORD` environment variable controls the admin password (default: `changeme123`).
3. Build and run the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Once running, access DVWA at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and Splunk at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Log in to Splunk with user `admin` and the password configured in step 2. DVWA uses the default credentials `admin` / `password`.
5. Generate traffic against DVWA and view the resulting logs in Splunk.

## Configuration
- `Dockerfile` builds the DVWA image and installs the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the DVWA and Splunk containers.
- `splunk-configs/inputs.conf` tells Splunk what files to monitor.
- `splunk-configs/props.conf` and `splunk-configs/transforms.conf` provide field extractions for the Apache logs.

## Troubleshooting
- If the containers fail to start, ensure your Splunk password meets complexity requirements.
- Use `docker-compose logs` to inspect container output for errors.
- If logs do not appear in Splunk, verify the forwarder configuration inside the DVWA container.
